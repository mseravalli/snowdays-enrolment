		  The BOLZANO SNOWDAYS are Europe's biggest wintersport event for students. Organized by the Sports Club University of Bolzano (S.C.U.B.) it gathers hundreds of students from all over Europe each year. This year (4th to the 6th of March) we plan to welcome about 400 students from 25 Universities.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Snowdays consist of THREE DAYS OF SPORT, PARTIES AND FUN all around Bolzano. Guest students will be hosted by local ones in the city center from where we will reach our daily locations by bus. Snowdays are famous for their ski and snowboard competition and the snowvolley tournament, but there is much more to see and to enjoy!
		</p>
		<p>
		  Just 75 Euros and you will be part of this amazing event! Everything is included except for travel costs to reach Bolzano, the extra alcohol you may be still willing to drink beside the free drinks we offer you at the parties (if your liver can cope with it) and Saturday's dinner.
		</p>
		<p>
		  You would like to join us? What you need are at least 4 other students from your university who would like to come. That won't be difficult! You may contact us per e-mail at <a href="mailto:snowdays@unibz.it">snowdays@unibz.it</a>. More contacts on the Contact Us page.
